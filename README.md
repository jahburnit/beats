BEAT REPOSITORY
===============

Due to project files changing, I am not not wanting to have to e-mail myself project files and/or upload them to a secure location.

I figure, since this is how I have secured my other assets in the past, it should work just the same. (It is also the reason why I probably still have my assets and the option to be able to throw a mountain of litigation at this fuck.)

September Problem Log:
* Problems kind of sub-sided, so I can sort of make music again now (unlike all of summer). I have been making music for 10 years. Now, I don't care about the music anymore. I care more about bypassing the hacker to get a take in. For every 20 minutes of session, I get like 10 seconds of musical output. Everything is LOGGED too, because this is the official BETA version with session cooking =D.

Now I am using GITHUB to store saves, since re-opening project files proved sabotage. Go figure.

Labor Day Weekend:
- No MIDI problems

Week After Labor Day Weekend:
- No MIDI problems, until about ~10mins into working on the session

Week After Labor Day Week (Sep 9 - 11)
- MIDI problems similar to August (Record Latency - Arbitrary Nudging)

Friday Night,  Following Weekend (Sep 12)
- No MIDI problems (Takes record normally - Weird filter ranges appear)

Saturday Night, Next Night (Sep 13)
- MIDI problems (Started OK, then messed up a little bit -- I was playing shitty though, but the problem "turned off" again when I began recording videos with my Android)




* Since I am using the official BETA version of Reason, which is not public, all these weird "delayed traces" and shit are logged in their entirety.
