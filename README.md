BEAT REPOSITORY
===============

Due to project files changing, I am not not wanting to have to e-mail myself project files and/or upload them to a secure location.

I figure, since this is how I have secured my other assets in the past, it should work just the same. (It is also the reason why I probably still have my assets and the option to be able to throw a mountain of litigation at this fuck.)
