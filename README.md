BEAT REPOSITORY
===============

Due to project files changing, I am not not wanting to have to e-mail myself project files and/or upload them to a secure location.

I figure, since this is how I have secured my other assets in the past, it should work just the same. (It is also the reason why I probably still have my assets and the option to be able to throw a mountain of litigation at this fuck.)

September Problem Log:
* Problems kind of sub-sided, so I can sort of make music again now (unlike all of summer). I have been making music for 10 years. Now, I don't care about the music anymore. I care more about bypassing the hacker to get a take in. For every 20 minutes of session, I get like 10 seconds of musical output. Everything is LOGGED too, because this is the official BETA version with session cooking =D.

Now I am using GITHUB to store saves, since re-opening project files proved sabotage. Go figure.

Labor Day Weekend:
- No MIDI problems

Week After Labor Day Weekend:
- No MIDI problems, until about ~10mins into working on the session

Week After Labor Day Week (Sep 9 - 11)
- MIDI problems similar to August (Record Latency - Arbitrary Nudging)

Friday Night,  Following Weekend (Sep 12)
- No MIDI problems (Takes record normally - Weird filter ranges appear)

Saturday Night, Next Night (Sep 13)
- MIDI problems (Started OK, then messed up a little bit -- I was playing shitty though, but the problem "turned off" again when I began recording videos with my Android)

Sunday (Sep 14)
- Extension of problem that begun happening for the first time in September last night. Now, playing the keys is problematic as there is some kind of invisible element modifying the decay rate of various filter and amplitude envelopes on various synthesizers. What is happening here, is after the note triggers, the decay rate is set so that it doesn't sustain until just enough time has passed for it to settle where the tempo sounds like it falls out of sync. (even if played well and/or hard quantized to quarter notes with the appropriate attack settings...)  AGAIN: This is the first occurrance of this problem. So far this month, I have at least been able to monitor everything normally; except for recorded playback issues that popped up on/off again (rarely, though).
- New problem: I am not hearing what I am seeing at all. And if I click and hold a fader on a Mixer, I will begin to hear it go really sour like. Before even moving it, I will hear it turn down, and then a notch filter kick in or something retarded sounding...




* Since I am using the official BETA version of Reason, which is not public, all these weird "delayed traces" and shit are logged in their entirety.
